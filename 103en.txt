Unit 2: Projections of Points and Lines (05 Hrs.)<br>
Projections of points in all possible position w.r.t. reference planes, Projections of lines when it is<br>
perpendicular to one of the reference planes, When line is inclined to one and parallel to other reference<br>
plane, Line inclined to both reference planes, Applications of projection of lines and concept of traces of<br>
lines.
</div>

Unit 3: Projections of Planes and Solids (05 Hrs.)<br>
Projections of planes when it is parallel to one of the reference planes, lying in reference plane, when it is<br>
perpendicular to one and inclined to other reference plane, when it is inclined to both reference planes,<br>
Projections on auxiliary planes. Projection of solid when axis is perpendicular to one of the reference<br>
planes, when axis is inclined to one and parallel to other reference plane, When axis is inclined to both the<br>
reference planes, Projection of cube, right regular prisms, Right regular pyramids, Right circular cylinder,<br>
Right circular cone, Tetrahedron, Frustum of solids.
